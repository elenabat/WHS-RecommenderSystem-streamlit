Sítio Roberto Burle Marx,"<p>Situated west of Rio de Janeiro, the site embodies a successful project developed over more than 40 years by landscape architect and artist Roberto Burle Marx (1909-1994) to create a “living work of art” and a “landscape laboratory” using native plants and drawing on Modernist ideas. Began in 1949, the garden features the key characteristics that came to define Burle Marx’s landscape gardens and influenced the development of modern gardens internationally. The garden is characterized by sinuous forms, exuberant mass planting, architectural plant arrangements, dramatic colour contrasts, use of tropical plants, and the incorporation of elements of traditional folk culture. By the end of the 1960s, the site housed the most representative collection of Brazilian plants, alongside other rare tropical species. In the site, 3,500 cultivated species of tropical and subtropical flora grow in harmony with the native vegetation of the region, notably mangrove swamp, restinga (a distinct type of coastal tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest) and the Atlantic Forest. Sítio Roberto Burle Marx exhibits an ecological conception of form as a process, including social collaboration which is the basis for environmental and cultural preservation. It is the first modern tropical garden to be inscribed on the World Heritage List.</p>",2021,Latin America and the Caribbean,SA,Brazil,Cultural,40.53,0,0,psituated west rio de janeiro embodies successful project developed year architect artist roberto burle marx create living work art laboratory using native plant drawing modernist idea began garden key characteristic came define burle marx garden influenced development modern garden internationally garden characterized sinuous exuberant mass planting architectural plant arrangement dramatic colour contrast use tropical plant incorporation element traditional folk culture end housed representative collection brazilian plant alongside rare tropical specie cultivated specie tropical subtropical flora grow harmony native vegetation notably mangrove swamp restinga distinct type coastal tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest atlantic forest sítio roberto burle marx exhibit ecological conception process social collaboration basis environmental cultural preservation modern tropical garden inscribed heritage listp
Settlement and Artificial Mummification of the Chinchorro Culture in the Arica and Parinacota Region,"<p>The property consists of three components: Faldeo Norte del Morro de Arica, Colón 10, both in the city of Arica, and Desembocadura de Camarones, in a rural environment some 100km further south. Together they bear testimony to a culture of marine hunter-gatherers who resided in the arid and hostile northern coast of the Atacama Desert in northernmost Chile from approximately 5450 BCE to 890 BCE. The property presents the oldest known archaeological evidence of the artificial mummification of bodies with cemeteries that contain both artificially mummified bodies and some that were preserved due to environmental conditions. Over time, the Chinchorro perfected complex mortuary practices, whereby they systematically dismembered and reassembled bodies of deceased men, women and children of the entire social spectrum to create “artificial” mummies. These mummies possess material, sculptural, and aesthetic qualities that are presumed to reflect the fundamental role of the dead in Chinchorro society. Tools made of mineral and plant materials as well as simple instruments made of bone and shells that enabled an intensive exploitation of marine resources, have been found in the property which bears a unique testimony to the complex spirituality of the Chinchorro culture.</p>",2021,Latin America and the Caribbean,SA,Chile,Cultural,364.05,0,0,property consists component faldeo norte del morro de arica colón arica desembocadura de camarones rural environment south together bear testimony culture marine huntergatherers resided arid hostile northern coast atacama desert northernmost chile approximately bce bce property present oldest known archaeological evidence artificial mummification body cemetery artificially mummified body preserved due environmental condition time chinchorro perfected mortuary practice whereby systematically dismembered reassembled body deceased men woman child entire social spectrum create artificial mummy mummy posse material sculptural aesthetic quality presumed reflect fundamental role dead chinchorro society tool made mineral plant material simple instrument made bone shell enabled intensive exploitation marine resource found property bear unique testimony spirituality chinchorro culturep

Sudanese style mosques in northern Côte d’Ivoire,"<p>The eight small adobe mosques, at Tengréla, Kouto, Sorobango, Samatiguila, M’Bengué, Kong and Kaouara are characterized by protruding timbers, vertical buttresses crowned by pottery or ostrich eggs, and tapering minarets. They present an interpretation of an architectural style thought to have originated around the 14th century in the town of Djenné, then part of the Empire of Mali, which prospered from the trade in gold and salt across the Sahara to North Africa. Particularly from the 16th century, the style spread south from the desert regions into the Sudanese savannah, becoming lower and developing stouter buttresses in response to the wetter climate. The mosques are the best conserved of 20 such edifices that remain in Côte d’Ivoire, where hundreds existed early last century. The mosques’ distinctive Sudanese style, specific to the savannah region of West Africa, developed between the 17th and 19th centuries as traders and scholars spread south from the Empire of Mali, extending the trans-Saharan mercantile routes into the forest area. They present highly important testimonies to the trans-Saharan trade that facilitated the expansion of Islam and Islamic culture and reflect a fusion of Islamic and local architectural forms in a highly distinctive style that has persisted over time. </p>",2021,Africa,AF,Côte d'Ivoire,Cultural,0.1298,0,0,eight small adobe mosque tengréla kouto sorobango samatiguila bengué kong kaouara characterized protruding timber vertical buttress crowned pottery ostrich egg tapering minaret present interpretation architectural style thought originated around djenné empire mali prospered trade gold salt across sahara north africa particularly style spread south desert sudanese savannah becoming lower developing stouter buttress response wetter climate mosque best conserved edifice côte ivoire hundred existed early last mosque distinctive sudanese style specific savannah west africa developed trader scholar spread south empire mali extending transsaharan mercantile route forest present highly testimony transsaharan trade facilitated expansion islam islamic culture reflect fusion islamic local architectural highly distinctive style persisted time p
Cordouan Lighthouse,"The Lighthouse of Cordouan rises up on a shallow rocky plateau in the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Gironde estuary, in a highly exposed and hostile environment. Built in white limestone dressed blocks at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, it was designed by engineer Louis de Foix and remodelled by engineer Joseph Teulère in the late 18th century. A masterpiece of maritime signalling, Cordouan’s monumental tower is decorated with pilasters, columns modillions and gargoyles. It embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses and was built with the ambition of continuing the tradition of famous beacons of antiquity, illustrating the art of building lighthouses in a period of renewed navigation, when beacons played an important role as territorial markers and as instruments of safety. Finally, the increase of its height, in the late 18th century, and the changes to its light chamber, attest to the progress of science and technology of the period.

"Nice, Winter Resort Town of the Riviera","<p>The Mediterranean city Nice, near the Italian border, bears witness to the evolution of the winter climatic resort due to the city’s mild climate and seaside location at the foot of the Alps. From the middle of the 18th century, Nice attracted an increasing number of aristocratic and upper-class families, mainly British, who took to spending their winters there. In 1832, Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Savoy-Piedmont-Sardinia, adopted a regulatory urban plan aiming to make it attractive to foreigners. Shortly thereafter, the Camin dei Inglesi, a modest 2-metre wide path along the sea shore, was expanded to become a prestigious promenade, known as the Promenade des Anglais after the city was ceded to France in 1860. Over the next century, an increasing number of winter residents from other countries, notably Russia, flocked to the city driving successive phases of development of new areas next to the old medieval town. The diverse cultural influences of the winter residents and the desire to make the most of the climatic conditions and scenery of the place, shaped the urban planning and eclectic architectural styles of those areas, contributing to the city’s renown as a cosmopolitan winter resort. </p>",2021,Europe,EU,France,Cultural,7192.0,0,0,mediterranean nice near italian border bear witness evolution winter climatic resort due mild climate seaside location foot alp middle nice attracted increasing number aristocratic upperclass family mainly british took spending winter nice kingdom savoypiedmontsardinia adopted regulatory urban plan aiming make attractive foreigner shortly thereafter camin dei inglesi modest wide path along sea shore expanded become prestigious promenade known promenade de anglais ceded france next increasing number winter resident country notably russia flocked driving successive phase development new next old medieval diverse cultural influence winter resident desire make climatic condition scenery place shaped urban planning eclectic architectural style contributing renown cosmopolitan winter resort p

Cultural Landscape of Hawraman/Uramanat,"<p>The remote and mountainous landscape of Hawraman/Uramanat bears testimony to the traditional culture of the Hawrami people, an agropastoral Kurdish tribe that has inhabited the region since about 3000 BCE. The property, at the heart of the Zagros Mountains in the provinces of Kurdistan and Kermanshah along the western border of Iran, encompasses two components: the Central-Eastern Valley (Zhaverud and Takht, in Kurdistan Province); and the Western Valley (Lahun, in Kermanshah Province). The mode of human habitation in these two valleys has been adapted over millennia to the rough mountainous environment. Tiered steep-slope planning and architecture, gardening on dry-stone terraces, livestock breeding, and seasonal vertical migration are among the distinctive features of the local culture and life of the semi-nomadic Hawrami people who dwell in lowlands and highlands during different seasons of each year. Their uninterrupted presence in the landscape, which is also characterized by exceptional biodiversity and endemism, is evidenced by stone tools, caves and rock shelters, mounds, remnants of permanent and temporary settlement sites, and workshops, cemeteries, roads, villages, castles, and more. The 12 villages included in the property illustrate the Hawrami people’s evolving responses to the scarcity of productive land in their mountainous environment through the millennia. </p>",2021,Middle East,AS,Iran (Islamic Republic of),Cultural,106307.0,0,0,remote mountainous hawramanuramanat bear testimony traditional culture hawrami people agropastoral kurdish tribe inhabited since bce property heart zagros mountain province kurdistan kermanshah along western border iran encompasses component centraleastern valley zhaverud takht kurdistan province western valley lahun kermanshah province mode human habitation valley adapted millennium rough mountainous environment tiered steepslope planning architecture gardening drystone terrace livestock breeding seasonal vertical migration among distinctive local culture life seminomadic hawrami people dwell lowland highland different season year uninterrupted presence also characterized exceptional biodiversity endemism evidenced stone tool cave rock shelter mound remnant permanent temporary settlement workshop cemetery road village castle village included property illustrate hawrami people evolving response scarcity productive land mountainous environment millennium p

As-Salt - The Place of Tolerance and Urban Hospitality,"<p>Built on three closely-spaced hills in the Balqa highland of west-central Jordan, the city of As-Salt, was an important trading link between the eastern desert and the west. During the last 60 years of the Ottoman period, the region prospered from the arrival and settlement of merchants from Nablus, Syria, and Lebanon who made their fortunes in trade, banking, and farming. This prosperity attracted skilled craftsmen from different parts of the region who worked on transforming the modest rural settlement into a thriving town with a distinctive layout and an architecture characterized by large public buildings and family residences constructed of local yellow limestone. The site’s urban core includes approximately 650 significant historic buildings exhibiting a blend of European Art Nouveau and Neo-Colonial styles combined with local traditions. The city’s non-segregated development expresses tolerance between Muslims and Christians who developed traditions of hospitality evidenced in Madafas (guest houses, known as Dawaween) and the social welfare system known as Takaful Ijtimai’. These tangible and intangible aspects emerged through a melding of rural traditions and bourgeois merchants’ and tradespeople’s practices during the Golden Age of As-Salt’s development between 1860s to 1920s. </p>",2021,Middle East,AS,Jordan,Cultural,24.68,0,0,pbuilt closelyspaced hill balqa highland westcentral jordan assalt trading link eastern desert west last year ottoman prospered arrival settlement merchant nablus syria lebanon made fortune trade banking farming prosperity attracted skilled craftsman different worked transforming modest rural settlement thriving distinctive layout architecture characterized large public family residence constructed local yellow limestone urban core includes approximately significant historic exhibiting blend european art nouveau neocolonial style combined local tradition nonsegregated development express tolerance muslim christian developed tradition hospitality evidenced madafas guest house known dawaween social welfare known takaful ijtimai tangible intangible aspect emerged melding rural tradition bourgeois merchant tradespeople practice golden age assalt development p
Chankillo Archaeoastronomical Complex,"<p>The Chankillo Archaeoastronomical Complex is a prehistoric site (250-200 BC), located on the north-central coast of Peru, in the Casma Valley, comprising a set of constructions in a desert landscape that, together with natural features, functioned as a calendrical instrument, using the sun to define dates throughout the year. The site includes a triple-walled hilltop complex, known as the Fortified Temple, two building complexes called Observatory and Administrative Centre, a line of 13 cuboidal towers stretching along the ridge of a hill, and the Cerro Mucho Malo that complements the Thirteen Towers as a natural marker.

Roșia Montană Mining Landscape,"Located in the Metalliferous range of the Apuseni Mountains in the west of Romania, Roșia Montană features the most significant, extensive and technically diverse underground Roman gold mining complex known at the time of inscription. As Alburnus Maior, it was the site of extensive gold-mining during the Roman Empire. Over 166 years starting in 106 CE, the Romans extracted some 500 tonnes of gold from the site developing highly engineered works, different types of galleries totalling 7km and a number of waterwheels in four underground localities chosen for their high-grade ore. Wax‐coated wooden writing tablets have provided detailed legal, socio‐economic, demographic and linguistic information about the Roman mining activities, not just in Alburnus Maior but also across the wider Dacian province. The site demonstrates a fusion of imported Roman mining technology with locally developed techniques, unknown elsewhere from such an early era. Mining on the site was also carried out, albeit to a lesser extent, between medieval times and the modern era. The later extractive works surround and cut across the Roman galleries.

The works of Jože Plečnik in Ljubljana – Human Centred Urban Design,"<p>The work Jože Plečnik carried in Ljubljana between World War I and World War II present an example of a human centred urban design that successively changed the identity of the city following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when it changed from a provincial city into the symbolic capital of the people of Slovenia. The architect Jože Plečnik contributed to this transformation with his personal, profoundly human vision for the city, based on an architectural dialogue with the older city while serving the needs of emerging modern 20th century society. The property consists of a series of public spaces (squares, parks, streets, promenades, bridges) and public institutions (national library, churches, markets, funerary complex) that were sensitively integrated into the pre-existing urban, natural and cultural context and contributed to the city’s new identity. This highly contextual and human-scale urbanistic approach, as well as Plečnik’s distinctive architectural idiom, stand apart from the other predominant modernist principles of his time.

Bisotun,"<p>Bisotun is located along the ancient trade route linking the Iranian high plateau with Mesopotamia and features remains from the prehistoric times to the Median, Achaemenid, Sassanian, and Ilkhanid periods. The principal monument of this archaeological site is the bas-relief and cuneiform inscription ordered by Darius I, The Great, when he rose to the throne of the Persian Empire, 521 BC. The bas-relief portrays Darius holding a bow, as a sign of sovereignty, and treading on the chest of a figure who lies on his back before him. According to legend, the figure represents Gaumata, the Median Magus and pretender to the throne whose assassination led to Darius’s rise to power. Below and around the bas-reliefs, there are ca. 1,200 lines of inscriptions telling the story of the battles Darius waged in 521-520 BC against the governors who attempted to take apart the Empire founded by Cyrus. The inscription is written in three languages. The oldest is an Elamite text referring to legends describing the king and the rebellions. This is followed by a Babylonian version of similar legends. The last phase of the inscription is particularly important, as it is here that Darius introduced for the first time the Old Persian version of his res gestae (things done). This is the only known monumental text of the Achaemenids to document the re-establishment of the Empire by Darius I. It also bears witness to the interchange of influences in the development of monumental art and writing in the region of the Persian Empire. There are also remains from the Median period (8th to 7th centuries B.C.) as well as from the Achaemenid (6th to 4th centuries B.C.) and post-Achaemenid periods.</p>",2006,Middle East,AS,Iran (Islamic Republic of),Cultural,187.0,0,0,pbisotun located along ancient trade route linking iranian high plateau mesopotamia remains prehistoric time median achaemenid sassanian ilkhanid principal monument archaeological basrelief cuneiform inscription ordered darius rose throne persian empire bc basrelief portrays darius holding bow sign sovereignty treading chest figure lie back according legend figure represents gaumata median magus pretender throne whose assassination led darius rise power around basreliefs ca line inscription telling story battle darius waged bc governor attempted take apart empire founded cyrus inscription written language oldest elamite text referring legend describing king rebellion followed babylonian version similar legend last phase inscription particularly darius introduced time old persian version gestae thing done known monumental text achaemenids document reestablishment empire darius also bear witness interchange influence development monumental art writing persian empire also remains median bc achaemenid bc postachaemenid periodsp

Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works,"<p>Humberstone and Santa Laura works contain over 200 former saltpeter works where workers from Chile, Peru and Bolivia lived in company towns and forged a distinctive communal pampinos culture. That culture is manifest in their rich language, creativity, and solidarity, and, above all, in their pioneering struggle for social justice, which had a profound impact on social history. Situated in the remote Pampas, one of the driest deserts on Earth, thousands of pampinos lived and worked in this hostile environment for over 60 years, from 1880, to process the largest deposit of saltpeter in the world, producing the fertilizer sodium nitrate that was to transform agricultural lands in North and South America, and in Europe, and produce great wealth for Chile.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus),"<p>The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens, became the symbol of Bombay as the ‘Gothic City’ and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture.

Muskauer Park / Park Mużakowski,"<p>A landscaped park of 559.9 ha astride the Neisse River and the border between Poland and Germany, it was created by Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau from 1815 to 1844.
